### Iris Flower Classification
This project analyzes and classifies the famous Iris Flower Dataset using Python. The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset has three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
### Movie Recommendation System
This project is a Movie Recommendation System built in Python. It provides movie recommendations to users based on various techniques such as content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and hybrid methods
### Scales Prediction Project
This project is focused on predicting continuous values using machine learning models, such as predicting weight, temperature, or other measurable quantities (scales). The model can be applied to various domains depending on the data used.

### Titanic Survival Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The project uses various machine learning algorithms to predict whether a passenger survived or not, based on features like age, sex, class, and other details available in the Titanic dataset.
